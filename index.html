            <p> A loop is not an example of abstraction. Loops make the code more effiecient by not repeating the same code over and over again but it isn't hidden from the coder. If a loop was in a function then it would be an abstraction but only because functions are an example of abstraction. If the loop uses a function then the function inside of the loop is an abstraction but not the loop itself. A loop is just a way to take repetitive code and put it all in one place.

            <p>  Did you know that how you swipe your phone can determine a lot about you? From the speed of the swipe to the amount of force you put on your phone some computers are able to track whether or not its really you swiping. Everyone has there own touch. People's bodies have slightly different temperatures, they swipe at different angles. People also have different sized fingers and different lengthed swipes. Computers are even able to track the angle of your fingers. Not to mention which finger you use and your individual fingerprints. I find it so fastenating that a computer can track how you swipe your finger. I would've never guessed something as simple as a swipe could tell so much about who you are. </p>

            <p> A good citizen, in a world where technology is neither good nor bad, but instead brings about change is respectful. To be respectful on the internet one must be courteous with others' feelings. Realizing that people have differences, a good citizen would spread information not to hurt anyone but to circulate ideas. A good citizen would also use the internet responsibly. Knowing that whatever they put out there can't get taken away, a good citizen would think before putting anything that causes harm on the internet. Finally a good citizen would be honest and integral. Honesty and integrity are two of the best traits to have. People listen to those who believe in what they are saying. Hiding behind a username and spouting hateful words to get a rise out of someone is pitiful. </p>
